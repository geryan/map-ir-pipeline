## Moyes data

- What are the columns Latitute/Longitude_XX (1-20)?
- longitude and latitude have about 7% missing data - these rows are all dropped so that we can use them as SF data
- Understanding "NR" and "NF" vs NA.
  - At the moment we are going to replace "NR" and "NF" with NA
  - But I do have a function to give an overview of the amount of NRs and NFs
- Percent mortality is sometimes present when both tested and dead are missing
    - I assume that we can't accept these values?
